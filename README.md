# Soil Moisture and Temperature Measurement with Arduino and Python Pandas and Matplotlib

## Description

This project aims to monitor soil moisture and temperature using Arduino-based sensors and process the collected data using Python scripts. The Arduino code collects data from various sensors and stores it on a micro SD card. The Python script then retrieves the data from the SD card, processes it, and generates plots for visualization.

## Hardware Components

- Arduino UNO 
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- Capacitive soil moisture sensor v1.2
- Micro SD card adapter module
- Power Unit

## Arduino Code

The Arduino code (`sensor_data_collection.ino`) reads data from sensors and stores it in a CSV file on a micro SD card.

## Python Scripts

The Python script (`data_processing.py`) processes the data stored on the micro SD card and generates plots using pandas and matplotlib.

The Python script (`comparative_analysis.py`) generates plots for different soil types using pandas and matplotlib to enable comparative analysis.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib

### Usage

1. Upload the `sensor_data_collection.ino` file to your Arduino board.
2. Connect the sensors to the appropriate pins on the Arduino board.
3. Take your measurements.
4. Run the `data_processing.py` script. Make sure the micro SD card is properly inserted into your computer and the script uses the correct path.
5. The script will read the data on the micro SD card, process it, and generate plots.
6. Select the soil type in which the measurements were taken via command line and decide if you want to generate plots for a time range including the newly processed data.
7. The script will store the data to your local machine and delete the CSV file from the micro SD card.
8. Run the `comparative_analysis.py` script to generate plots for comparison between different soil types.

### Example Data

Included in the repository is an example CSV file (`example_data.csv`) containing sample sensor data. You can use this data to test the `data_processing.py` script.

### Plots

Below are example plots generated by the scripts:
